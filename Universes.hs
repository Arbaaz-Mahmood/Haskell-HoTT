-- It would be more organized and structured to create a separate Type module with complete definitions for types, and then create a Universe module dependent on the Type module. This would allow for a clear separation of concerns and make it easier to understand and maintain the code.

--For example, the Type module could define a Type type and associated functions and type classes, while the Universe module could use the Type type and related functions and type classes to define a Universe type and associated functions and type classes. This would make it clear which definitions and functions are related to types and which are related to universes.
