--Define the NumberSystem data type, which will represent a number system. This data type should include fields for the type of numbers contained in the system and the operations that can be performed on those numbers.

data NumberSystem a = NumberSystem a (Fun a a -> a) (Fun a a -> a) (Fun a a -> a)
--Define a function for creating a new number system. This function should take the type of numbers contained in the system and the functions for performing addition, subtraction, and multiplication as arguments, and should return a NumberSystem value.
createNumberSystem :: a -> (Fun a a -> a) -> (Fun a a -> a) -> (Fun a a -> a) -> NumberSystem a
createNumberSystem t add sub mul = NumberSystem t add sub mul
--Define a function for accessing the type, operations, and properties of a NumberSystem value. This function should take a NumberSystem value as an argument, and should return the type, operations, and properties of the number system.

getNumberSystem :: NumberSystem a -> (a, (Fun a a -> a), (Fun a a -> a), (Fun a a -> a))
getNumberSystem (NumberSystem t add sub mul) = (t, add, sub, mul)
--Define a function for adding a property to a NumberSystem value. This function should take a NumberSystem value and a property to add as arguments, and should return a new NumberSystem value with the added property.
--Define a function for adding a property to a NumberSystem value. This function should take a NumberSystem value and a property to add as arguments, and should return a new NumberSystem value with the added property.

addPropertyToNumberSystem (NumberSystem t add sub mul) p = NumberSystem t add sub mul p
--Define a function for accessing the properties of a NumberSystem value. This function should take a NumberSystem value as an argument, and should return the set of properties of the number system.

getProperties :: NumberSystem a -> Set Property
getProperties (NumberSystem t add sub mul p) = p
--Define a function for checking whether a NumberSystem value satisfies a given property. This function should take a NumberSystem value and a property to check as arguments, and should return True if the number system satisfies the property, and False otherwise.

satisfiesProperty :: NumberSystem a -> Property -> Bool
satisfiesProperty (NumberSystem t add sub mul p) prop = elem prop p
--With these functions defined, users of your library will be able to create and manipulate number systems and their properties as needed for their particular applications. For example, they could use the createNumberSystem function to define a number system of natural numbers, and then use the addPropertyToNumberSystem function to add the property of commutativity to the number system.

--Example:
-- Define a number system of natural numbers
let natNumberSystem = createNumberSystem Nat addNat subNat mulNat

-- Add the property of commutativity to the number system
let natNumberSystemWithCommutativity = addPropertyToNumberSystem natNumberSystem Commutativity
