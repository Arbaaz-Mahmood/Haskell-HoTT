-- The Univalence type class represents the core definition of the
-- univalence axiom and the notion of isomorphism for types.
class Univalence a b where
isIsomorphic :: a -> b -> Bool

-- The Identity type class represents the notion of identity for types.
class Identity a where
isIdentical :: a -> a -> Bool

-- The Equivalence type class represents the notion of equivalence for types.
class Equivalence a where
isEquivalent :: a -> a -> Bool

-- The Homotopy type class represents the notion of homotopy for types.
class Homotopy a where
isHomotopic :: a -> a -> Bool

-- The HomotopyEquivalence type class represents the notion of homotopy
-- equivalence for types.
class HomotopyEquivalence a where
isHomotopyEquivalent :: a -> a -> Bool

-- The Type synonym represents the types in a homotopy type theory system.
type Type = forall a. (Univalence a, Identity a, Equivalence a, Homotopy a, HomotopyEquivalence a) => a

-- The Universe synonym represents the universes in a homotopy type theory system.
type Universe = forall u. (Univalence u, Identity u, Equivalence u, Homotopy u, HomotopyEquivalence u) => [Type]

-- The TypeHierarchy type class provides support for the hierarchy of types
-- and universes in homotopy type theory.
class TypeHierarchy a where
-- Defines a type at a given level of the hierarchy.
defineType :: Int -> a -> Type
-- Returns the level of the hierarchy for a given type.
typeLevel :: Type -> Int
-- Returns the universe for a given level of the hierarchy.
universeAt :: Int -> Universe

-- Example usage:

-- Define a type Nat at level 0 of the hierarchy.
let natType = defineType 0 "Nat"

-- Get the level of the hierarchy for the Nat type.
let natTypeLevel = typeLevel natType
-- This will return 0.

-- Get the universe at level 0 of the hierarchy.
let level0Universe = universeAt 0
-- This will return a list of all the types defined at level 0.
